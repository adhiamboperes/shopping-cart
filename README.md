# shopping-cart
A fix for customers abandoning their shopping carts before completing their purchase on an eCommerce mobile application, as implemented by a team of 4 Mobile Engineers.

### Real-world problem:
a. **Customer problem:** Customers are abandoning their shopping carts before completing their purchase on an eCommerce mobile application.

b. **How do you know it is a problem?** We know it is a problem because the eCommerce application's analytics indicate that many users add items to their shopping cart but never complete the purchase.

c. **Why is it critical to solve the problem?** Abandoned shopping carts can lead to lost sales and revenue for the eCommerce business. By addressing the issue, the business can increase conversion rates and revenue.

d. **How will you measure the success of the solution?** We will measure the success of the solution by tracking the number of completed purchases and comparing it to the previous rate of abandoned shopping carts.

### Assume you are the Senior Engineer in a mobile team with the following composition: 1 Senior Engineer, 2 Mid-Level Engineers and 1 Junior Engineer.

#### Explain your solution to solve the problem described above.
i. **Use at least 2 diagrams to illustrate your ideas.**

#### Break down the problem described above into several cards / tasks with the
assumption that the solution should be completed in 6 weeks:

i. For each card / tasks:
1. Have a title
2. Have an estimate
3. Have a brief summary
4. Have an assignee (level of assignee should be stated)

**Title: Simplify the checkout flow.**
